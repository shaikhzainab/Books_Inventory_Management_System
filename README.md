# Books_Inventory_Management_System

The offered code is a simple Django REST framework implementation of a library management system.

It outlines the Book, Student, and Inventory models.

The title, author, and ISBN of each book that is checked out from the library are all stored in the Book model.

The Student model maintains information about the library users, including their name, email, and books issued.

The inventory model displays the quantity and type of books currently on hand at the library.

The three models' respective serializers—BookSerializer, StudentSerializer, and InventorySerializer—are defined in the code.

Data can be serialised or deserialized into or out of JSON formats using these serializers.

Additionally, the code defines a number of views that process HTTP requests using Django's generic views.
These views are BookListCreateView, BookRetrieveUpdateDeleteView, StudentListCreateView, StudentRetrieveUpdateDeleteView, InventoryListCreateView, InventoryRetrieveUpdateDeleteView, IssueBookView, ReturnBookView, and PopularBooksView. 

These views handle CRUD operations for the models and also provide additional functionalities such as issuing and returning books and displaying popular books.
